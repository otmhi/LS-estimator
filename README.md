# Logarithmic Smoothing for Pessimistic Off-Policy Evaluation, Selection and Learning

Source code for the paper ["Logarithmic Smoothing for Pessimistic Off-Policy Evaluation, Selection and Learning" - Otmane Sakhi, Imad Aouali, Pierre Alquier, Nicolas Chopin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14335) published at NeuRIPS 2024 (Spotlight).


## Creating the environment

A virtual Python environment can be created from the requirement file holding all the needed packages to reproduce the results of the paper.

    virtualenv -p python3.9 pess_ls
    source pess_ls/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run experiments

### Run OPE/OPS experiments

The OPE/OPS experiments are built on the experiments conducted in ["Kuzborskij, I., Vernade, C., Gyorgy, A., & Szepesv√°ri, C. (2021, March). Confident off-policy evaluation and selection through self-normalized importance weighting. In International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (pp. 640-648). PMLR."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10460). 

The code for these experiments is heavily inspired from their associated [Github package](https://github.com/google-deepmind/offpolicy_selection_eslb).

OPE and OPS experiments are defined in the ope_ops folder, move to it if you want to run them.

    cd ope_ops
    
To run OPE experiments, please execute:

    python policy_evaluation.py

To run OPS experiments, please execute:

    python policy_selection.py

### Run OPL experiments

OPL experiments are defined in the opl folder, move to it if you want to run them.

    cd opl

To run OPL experiments, please execute:

    python policy_learning.py
